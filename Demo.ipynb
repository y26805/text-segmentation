The fund will also invest all throughout Latin America, including countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. ¤“There is so much innovation and disruption taking place in the region, and I believe the business opportunities have never been stronger,” said Claure. “The SoftBank Innovation Fund will become a major investor in transformative Latin American companies that are poised to redefine their industries and create new economic opportunities for millions of people.” ¤Softbank, which already has a $100 billion investment vehicle known as Softbank Vision Fund, has made large investments in ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies, shared office provider WeWork, food delivery startup DoorDash and dog walking app Wag. ¤'"
